"""Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
"""

    #Calculates the sum of squares of digits

        rem = num%10;    
        sum = sum + (rem*rem);

result = num;    
     
while(result != 1 and result != 4):    
    result = isHappyNumber(result);    
     
#Happy number always ends with 1    
if(result == 1):    
    print(str(num) + " is a happy number");    
#Unhappy number ends in a cycle of repeating numbers which contain 4    
elif(result == 4):    
    print(str(num) + " is not a happy number");
